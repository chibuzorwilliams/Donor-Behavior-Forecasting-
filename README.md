# Donor-Behavior-Forecasting-
Can we predict, on Day 1, whether a donor will give again within 35 days? Using behavioral signals from a donor's first 24 hours (e.g., time, device, co-donors, donation type) aftergiving, we developed a machine learning model to predict future giving. The goal is to predict if a donor will return to give within 35 days.
